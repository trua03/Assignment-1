There are as of now two examples of networking code: Dr.J's sample code, and a simpler code from GeeksForGeeks. here is how they work

DR.J TCP:
This has 2 Varients, a message varient and a file varient
Message:
1. you first run the TCPServer.java
2. second you run the TCPClient.java
3. then enter a message to send to the server in the TCPClient Window
4. check the server window for your message
File:
1. edit the test.txt file
2. run the TCPServerFile.java
3. run the TCPClientFile.java
4. check the tetResponse.txt file, it should match test.txt

Geeks For Geeks TCP:
1. you first run the serverSide.java
2. second you run the clientSide.java
3. then enter a message to send to the server in the clientSide Window
4. check the server window for your message
this one is the same as dr.j's but is written in a different way, could be useful

DR.J UDP:
This has 2 varients, they both do the same thing, however, files marked with a 2 can send multiple messages, while files marked with 1 only send 1 message then close
1. you first run the UDPServer.java
2. second you run the UDPClient.java
3. then enter a message to send to the server in the UDPClient Window
4. check the server window for your message
